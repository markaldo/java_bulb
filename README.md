# Java Automated Light Source Simulation

**A simple Java project simulating automated light sources (bulbs and lamps).**

## Description

This project is a basic Java program that simulates the behavior of automated light sources. It includes classes for `Bulb` and `Lamp`, allowing you to create instances of these objects and control their on/off state. The project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts and can be used as a starting point for more complex lighting simulations.

## Key Classes

*   `Bulb.java`: Represents a single light bulb. Includes methods to turn the bulb on and off, and to check its current state.
*   `Lamp.java`: Represents a lamp, which contains a bulb. Includes methods to control the lamp (which in turn controls the bulb).
*   `LightsApp.java`: A simple application that demonstrates how to create and use `Bulb` and `Lamp` objects.
*   `BulbTest.java`: JUnit tests for the Bulb class.
*   `LampTest.java`: JUnit tests for the Lamp class.

## Usage

The `LightsApp.java` file provides a simple example of how to use the `Bulb` and `Lamp` classes. You can compile and run this file to see the simulation in action.

## Potential Improvements

*   **More Realistic Simulation:** Add more realistic features such as dimming, color changes, and energy consumption.
*   **GUI Implementation:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the light sources.
*   **Automation:** Implement more sophisticated automation logic, such as timers and sensors.
*   **Testing:** Add more unit tests to improve code coverage and reliability.
